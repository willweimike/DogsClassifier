# DogsClassifier

## A model finetuned from YOLOv8n which aims to classify different breeds of Dogs

## Motivation
Due to the complexity on breeds of stray dogs, I decide to train a model to detect the most possible dog breed.

## Dataset
Dataset is prepared by using [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/) and [Cats and dogs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6248092).

12 + 1 breeds are picked (There are two kinds of corgi)


### Dog breeds includes: 
- Beagle
- Cardigan (Corgi)
- Chihuahua
- German Shepherd
- Golden Retriever
- Maltese
- Miniature Poodle
- Labrador Retriever
- Pembroke (Corgi)
- Pomeranian
- Samoyed
